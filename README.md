# developer-web
A personal website to capture my evolution in the software development.

**Sunday Abril 3, 2022**

Today I took a free design in Figma from @ernestechie. That design will allows me to develop my programming skills because I can't view the code, just the design. But if I take like a guide another website I can view the code and that don't make me improve my programing skills. As the design was only for desktop I had to make an adaptation for the mobile design.

Both Design looked like this:

With that clear, I will try start the developing with the mobile firts methodology, and then with CSS MediaQuery I will make the adaptation to Desktop design.

I don't know how far I will go tonight, but I will try make all the HTML code. To start tomorrow to style it.

Yesterday I worked until at 10:00 p.m. and I was able advance to the form in the final homepage.
Today I was working in many things, like the next:
1. I was finishing the form, that task was a little hard to me, because I don't knew how modify the font-size of placeholder.
2. I also worked in to make the website responsive, that was new to me, because I don't knew how it is worked. So I had to search how it work, read it, watch youtube videos and see forums. But finally I can understand how it works, and then I was able to adapt it to my web.
3. It was 10:30 at night and I was finishing the Media Query from Desktop view and everything broke. I donÂ´t have idea how it happened, but I thing that could be because I added the next code: display: flex !important;
What happens is that the width of the device is not respected.The width is exceeded.
4. Maybe tomorrow I can fix the problem. By now I will a push in a branch, and after of that I will go to sleep.
