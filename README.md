# developer-web
A personal website to capture my evolution in the software development.

**Sunday Abril 3, 2022**

Today I took a free design in Figma from @ernestechie. That design will allows me to develop my programming skills because I can't view the code, just the design. But if I take like a guide another website I can view the code and that don't make me improve my programing skills. As the design was only for desktop I had to make an adaptation for the mobile design.

Both Design looked like this: 
https://www.figma.com/file/yQZPh20fXOe1yu26LzrqCn/Carlos-web-developer---Portfolio-Website-Design-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1

With that clear, I will try start the developing with the mobile firts methodology, and then with CSS MediaQuery I will make the adaptation to Desktop design.

I don't know how far I will go tonight, but I will try make all the HTML code. To start tomorrow to style it.

Yesterday I worked until at 10:00 p.m. and I was able advance to the form in the final homepage.
Today I was working in many things, like the next:
1. I was finishing the form, that task was a little hard to me, because I don't knew how modify the font-size of placeholder.
2. I also worked in to make the website responsive, that was new to me, because I don't knew how it is worked. So I had to search how it work, read it, watch youtube videos and see forums. But finally I can understand how it works, and then I was able to adapt it to my web.
3. It was 10:30 at night and I was finishing the Media Query from Desktop view and everything broke. I don´t have idea how it happened, but I thing that could be because I added the next code: display: flex !important;
What happens is that the width of the device is not respected.The width is exceeded.
4. Maybe tomorrow I can fix the problem. By now I will a push in a branch, and after of that I will go to sleep.

Today I was able to solve yestarday problem. But now I found a new problem related to images. these images don´t respect the width and the heigth. I don't know why, but tomorrow I will try to solve it.

It's 1:30 a.m. on April 7. Today I tried to solve the problem from yesterday but I couldn't. I spent all day trying to solve it, but finally I decided start again on a document called new.html and new.css. In this case I forgot the mobile firts methodology and comeback to develop for desktop firts. Why I do this? well, because when I was adding the Media Querys for the distins resolutions I found with a problem series that maked me feel very disorientated. By now largely finished desktop development.

Today I have achieved solved the bugs that I have been commenting on. It's the 7:39 p.m. And for now it only remains add the burguer button menu on the botton in  the page, to make it easier for users to navigate from mobile phones. Also, I will study how I can implement a Dark Mode (In this case Light Mode) to the website. By now I am happy for the evolution of the project. I don't know if start another page to reinforce my knowledge or make the leap to Javascript.
