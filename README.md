# developer-web
A personal website to capture my evolution in the software development.

**Sunday Abril 3, 2022**
Today I took a free design in Figma from @ernestechie. That design will allows me to develop my programming skills because I can't view the code, just the design. But if I take like a guide another website I can view the code and that don't make me improve my programing skills. As the design was only for desktop I had to make an adaptation for the mobile design.

Both Design looked like this:

With that clear, I will try start the developing with the mobile firts methodology, and then with CSS MediaQuery I will make the adaptation to Desktop design.

I don't know how far I will go tonight, but I will try make all the HTML code. To start tomorrow to style it.
